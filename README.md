***Author:*** Wenjie Xie, ***Supervisor:*** Lingyun Chen 

Semester Project @KI.Fabrik, MIRMI, TUM
## Description
This repository is part of a semester project for the Design of Engineering Department at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). The project focuses on agile production robots within the KI.Fabrik Project. The primary objective is to set up an accurate and robust SLAM framework on the hardware provided and to evaluate and enhance its performance. Additionally, the project involves the real-time calibration of two single-line 2D LiDAR sensors on the robots, utilizing the Robot Operating System (ROS).
